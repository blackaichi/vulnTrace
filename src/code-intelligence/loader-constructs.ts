/**
 * The single source of truth for "is this construct a route to loading a
 * module or executing generated code, and which one?" (VT-307b semantics;
 * extracted from call-graph.ts in VT-307c-fix-3).
 *
 * Two layers consume it, and they must never drift apart:
 *
 * - `call-graph.ts` asks per visited call/`new`, to emit the correct
 *   `unknown(reason)` edge;
 * - `module-load-closure.ts` asks per LOADED FILE, over that file's whole
 *   AST, to decide whether its own module-load closure can be called
 *   complete.
 *
 * Before this extraction the closure had no classifier of its own and
 * instead adopted already-classified blockers from the call graph. That
 * made closure completeness silently depend on how far the *call* graph
 * happened to walk: a truncated graph never classified a transitively
 * loaded file's top-level `require(dynamicName)`, so the closure reported
 * `complete: true` for a file it had never examined for loaders at all
 * (the VT-307d soundness review's Blocker 3). Owning the classification
 * here makes closure completeness a property of the source the closure
 * actually read, independent of call-graph coverage entirely.

 * in fact load code the graph never discovered -- and the property-access
 * forms rooted in a known global (`module.require`, `globalThis.eval`)
 * were swallowed entirely by call-graph.ts's `KNOWN_GLOBAL_IDENTIFIERS`,
 * producing no edge at all. Checked BEFORE `bindCallee`/the generic
 * known-global suppression in both `classifyCall` and `classifyNew`.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative rather than attempting real alias-aware static
 * resolution: `const r = require; r("./literal")` is classified exactly
 * the same as `const r = require; r(dynamicValue)` -- both
 * `"aliased_require"` -- even though the literal form could, in principle,
 * be resolved exactly like a direct `require("./literal")`. Building that
 * would mean re-deriving `bindCallee`'s own specifier-resolution behavior
 * behind an extra indirection layer; VT-307b scopes this task to
 * classification only and always chooses the safe (widening) answer over
 * a more precise one that risks resolving the alias incorrectly.
 *
 * `const`-only, mirroring {@link resolveSingleAssignmentValue}'s own
 * documented scope (a `let`/`var` alias could be reassigned between
 * declaration and call, so tracking it correctly needs real reassignment
 * analysis -- out of scope here, same as VT-214's identical restriction).
 * A `let r = require; r(x);` therefore still falls through to the generic
 * `unsupported_construct` fallback today -- a known, deliberate boundary,
 * not an oversight; closing it would require the same kind of general
 * alias-analysis redesign this function's own doc comment already declines
 * for the literal-argument case above.
