# Real-World Validation Findings

A running log of every gap discovered by scanning real, npm-installed
packages against real CVEs/GHSAs (`tests/validation/`) — kept up to date
after every validation run, per the same discipline as the adversarial
suites: a disagreement between VulnTrace and an independently-researched
oracle is recorded here and the case is kept failing (`knownFailure: true`
in `cases/cases.json`), never silently fixed away or hidden.

Each entry is a candidate for a future remediation task, not yet
implemented. Nothing in this file changes analyzer behavior by itself.

## Benchmark design note (not a VulnTrace defect) — `RWB-09b`

`RWB-09b`'s expected verdict (`NOT_AFFECTED`, for the patched `semver@7.5.2`
instance) is a case where the *benchmark's own oracle design* doesn't
match how VulnTrace actually represents "not vulnerable." The real scan
result for that instance is **`NO_FINDING`** — no findings-array entry at
all — not an explicit finding carrying verdict `NOT_AFFECTED`. This is
**correct, intentional VulnTrace behavior**: `buildFinding` (`src/analysis
/verdict.ts`) returns `undefined` (no finding emitted) whenever
`matchResult === "not_affected"` (a package instance confidently outside
every vulnerable range) — the same behavior that keeps a scan's `findings`
array free of noise for the overwhelming majority of a project's
dependencies that were never vulnerable in the first place. `RWB-09b`'s
`findingSelector`-based lookup (matching `tests/validation/validation
.test.ts`'s existing convention for every other case) can only ever find
`NOT_AFFECTED`/`AFFECTED`/`UNKNOWN` inside an *existing* findings-array
entry — it has no way to represent "the correct answer is that no finding
should exist at all." Per the task instructions governing this benchmark
implementation ("do not change expected verdicts unless the benchmark
design is proven factually incorrect — stop and report instead"), `RWB-09
b`'s `expected` field is left as `NOT_AFFECTED` and the case is marked
`knownFailure: true` rather than silently reshaping the oracle or the
runner. A future revision of the case format (see `docs/VALIDATION-
STRATEGY.md § 7`'s already-proposed additional fields) should add an
explicit way to assert "no finding for this instance" as its own expected
outcome, distinct from an explicit `NOT_AFFECTED` verdict.

## Benchmark methodology note — VT-303 cause-splitting

The independent audit (`docs/REAL-WORLD-BENCHMARK-AUDIT-V0.1.md` § 9.2)
identified `RWB-06` and `RWB-09` as **cause-confounded**: each mixes an
intended thesis with one or more unrelated, independent mechanisms, so a
single pass/fail result can't tell an observer which one actually changed.
VT-303 added clean, single-cause siblings for both, **without modifying
either original fixture or its oracle**:

| Original (unchanged) | Confounds | New sibling | Isolates |
|---|---|---|---|
| `RWB-06` (UNREACHED_DEPENDENCY thesis) | UNREACHED_DEPENDENCY **+** an incidental `token.trim()` `unsupported_construct` (RWF-002) that drives the actual UNKNOWN result | `RWB-06A` | UNREACHED_DEPENDENCY alone — zero other unresolved/dynamic constructs anywhere in the reachable subgraph (verified: 2 graph nodes, 0 edges) |
| `RWB-09` (MULTI_INSTANCE thesis) | npm-alias identity (RWF-009) **+** cross-file re-export resolution (RWF-004) **+** (pre-VT-302) non-hermetic resolution (RWF-010, since fixed) **+** the NO_FINDING oracle-design limitation on the patched instance (RWB-09b, above) | `RWB-11a`/`RWB-11b` | package-instance discrimination alone — two real, unaliased, differently-versioned `url-parse` installs (one nested under a fixture-authored wrapper, one top-level), using the same whole-module-default-export target shape `RWB-04` already proves resolves cleanly, so export attribution can't be a second variable either |

Both original cases are kept exactly as they were — `RWB-06` remains the
RWF-002 exhibit (its blast-radius demonstration is the point: an entirely
unrelated built-in-method call, nothing to do with `node-forge`, is
sufficient to suppress the correct verdict), and `RWB-09` remains the
dedicated **ALIASED_INSTALL** stress case (reclassified here from its
original bare "MULTI_INSTANCE" label, now that a genuine, non-aliased
multi-instance case exists separately to compare against). Neither RWF-002,
RWF-004, RWF-009, nor RWF-010 is fixed by this task — see each finding's
own entry.

All four new cases (`RWB-06A`, `RWB-11a`, `RWB-11b`) currently **pass**,
each independently confirmed via direct call-graph/target-resolution
inspection (not verdict-only): `RWB-06A` — 0 graph edges, `node-forge`
never discovered; `RWB-11a` — a clean 3-hop evidence path to the `Url`
constructor, `packageId.name` correctly `"url-parse"` (no identity
mismatch); `RWB-11b` — the top-level instance is never discovered by the
call graph, and the 44 unrelated `unsupported_construct` edges elsewhere
in `url-parse`'s own internals (real, non-trivial production code) are
all non-closure-widening, so VT-300's guard correctly does not treat them
as a reason to doubt the `NOT_AFFECTED` conclusion.

## Status

| ID | Package | Root cause | Impact | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| RWF-001 | `lodash` (the main package) | UMD `module.exports` assignment via a locally-aliased variable is invisible to export detection | Precision only — degrades to UNKNOWN in both directions, never a false AFFECTED/NOT_AFFECTED | Open, not yet scoped as a task |
| RWF-002 | any (`node-forge` isolates it cleanly) | One unresolved/dynamic construct *anywhere* in an entrypoint's reachable call graph forces `UNKNOWN` for every vulnerability checked against that entrypoint, even when the construct is entirely unrelated to the target | Precision, but broad real-world reach — real applications routinely contain constructs the call graph can't fully model | **Bypassed for unloaded packages (VT-307d)**; the underlying reachability-scoping tradeoff remains open — see below |
| RWF-003 | `minimist` | `module.exports = function (...) {...}` (an anonymous function expression, not a named local declaration) isn't matched by export-to-function resolution | Precision only — degrades to UNKNOWN, never a false verdict | Open, not yet scoped as a task |
| RWF-004 | `qs`, `debug`→`ms`, `semver` | An exported value that is itself a re-export of a function declared in a *different* file (same-package sibling file or a different package entirely) is never chased to its real declaration | Precision only — degrades to UNKNOWN, never a false verdict | **RWF-004a (same package) fixed**; RWF-004b (cross-package) open |
| RWF-005 | `trim-newlines` | TypeScript module resolution prefers a package's hand-authored `.d.ts` over its real `.js` implementation when resolving a bare specifier from a plain `.js` importer | Precision only — degrades to UNKNOWN (analysis operates on a file with no real function bodies) | **Fixed (VT-304)** |
| RWF-006 | `fast-xml-parser` | A webpack-bundled, `Object.defineProperty`-getter-defined class export isn't recognized as a constructible/method-bearing target | Precision only — degrades to UNKNOWN, never a false verdict | Open, not yet scoped as a task |
| RWF-007 | `RWB-10` (`fs`, `path`) | `ts.resolveModuleName` never resolves Node builtin specifiers (`fs`, `node:fs`, ...) — every builtin `require`/`import` call produced an `unresolved_module` edge, a **closure-widening** blocker, in essentially every real Node application | Precision, universal blast radius (also a soundness *prerequisite*: combined with RWF-002, no realistic Node application could ever reach `NOT_AFFECTED` while this stood) | **Fixed (VT-305)** |
| RWF-009 | `semver` (`RWB-09a`, npm alias `semver-vulnerable`) | `identifyModule()` derived package *identity* purely from the install *directory* name, not the installed package's own declared `package.json` `"name"` — an npm-aliased install (`"semver-vulnerable": "npm:semver@7.5.1"`) was therefore invisible to `graphPackageInstances(graph, "semver")` even though the call graph genuinely traversed it | **Soundness** — a genuinely-reached aliased instance was silently treated as `confirmedAbsentInstance` (VT-212's guard, meant for a never-touched instance), producing a false `NOT_AFFECTED` for a package that was, in fact, reached and vulnerable | **Fixed (VT-306)** |
| RWF-012 | `ini` | A chained CommonJS export alias (`exports.parse = exports.decode = decode`) assigns the exported name `parse` to a function whose own declared name is `decode`; export-symbol attribution has no way to bridge the two | Precision only — degrades to UNKNOWN, never a false verdict (VT-301B correctly closed the adjacent soundness gap that let this coincidentally read as `NOT_AFFECTED` before) | Open, not yet scoped as a task |

## RWF-001 — UMD-style `module.exports` assignment via a locally-aliased variable is never recognized

**Discovered:** scanning real `lodash@4.17.15` against real GHSA-29mw-wpgm-hmr9 / CVE-2020-28500 (ReDoS in `trim`/`trimEnd`/`toNumber`).

**Symptom:** `VAL-002` and `VAL-003` (`tests/validation/cases/cases.json`) both return `UNKNOWN` for `lodash#trim` — one case where `trim()` is genuinely, directly called (correct answer: `AFFECTED`), and one where it's genuinely never called (correct answer: `NOT_AFFECTED`). Both directions are wrong, but both are *safe* wrong answers (UNKNOWN, never a false AFFECTED or false NOT_AFFECTED) — this is a precision gap, not a soundness violation.

**Root cause, confirmed by reading the actual installed `node_modules/lodash/lodash.js`:**

Real `lodash.js` does not export via an object literal (`module.exports = { trim, ... }`) or a direct `module.exports = <name>` assignment. It uses classic UMD boilerplate, feature-detecting the module system into local variables first:

```js
var freeExports = typeof exports == 'object' && exports && !exports.nodeType && exports;
var freeModule = freeExports && typeof module == 'object' && module && !module.nodeType && module;
// ... (~17000 lines later)
(freeModule.exports = _)._ = _;
```

`describeCommonJsExportTarget` (`src/code-intelligence/source-index.ts`) only recognizes a `module.exports = ...` assignment when the assignment target's own root identifier is *literally* `module` (`node.left.expression.text === "module"`). Here the assignment is `freeModule.exports = _` — `freeModule` is a separate local variable, not the literal `module` identifier — so this assignment is never recognized as a CommonJS export at all. The module falls back to having no named export table entry for `trim` (or anything else `lodash.js` attaches to `_` internally via scattered `lodash.trim = trim;`-style assignments throughout the file), so `resolveTargetNodes` can never find it — `unresolved_target`, which correctly (per SDD §3.3/§5) becomes `UNKNOWN` rather than a guess.

**Why this matters:** this is the single most common real-world idiom for a package that needs to work under CommonJS, AMD, *and* browser globals without a bundler — and `lodash` (the literal package, not per-method variants like `lodash.template`) is one of the most-installed packages in the entire npm ecosystem. Contrast with `lodash.template@4.5.0` (`VAL-001`), which uses a plain `module.exports = template;` — the exact pattern already handled — and resolves correctly to `AFFECTED` with a full two-hop evidence path.

**Relevant files:** `src/code-intelligence/source-index.ts` (`describeCommonJsExportTarget`, `findLastModuleExportsAssignment`-equivalent logic), `src/code-intelligence/module-model.ts` (`buildExportBindings`).

**Proposed direction (not scoped, not implemented):** recognize `<localIdentifier>.exports = ...` as a CommonJS export assignment when `<localIdentifier>` is itself a local variable whose own initializer is provably `module` (or a boolean/ternary expression that resolves to `module`, matching the exact UMD feature-detection idiom above) — a bounded, same-file, single-hop resolution in the same spirit as VT-214's alias tracking, not a general points-to change. Whether it's also worth tracing property assignments made *after* the export point (`lodash.trim = trim;` deep inside the file, before the module boundary is even known) is a separate, likely larger question the fix should scope explicitly rather than assume.

**MVP-readiness relevance:** does not violate any of the invariants checked by either adversarial suite (still 79/79, 100% — this finding is exclusively from the real-world suite). Confirms the real-world suite is already earning its keep: this pattern is absent from all 79 synthetic scenarios.

---

## RWF-002 — One unresolved construct anywhere in the reachable graph forces `UNKNOWN`, even when unrelated to the target being checked

**Discovered:** scanning real `node-forge@1.3.3` (`RWB-06`) against real GHSA-2328-f5f3-gj25 / CVE-2026-33896, in a fixture whose application code has **zero relationship to node-forge at all**.

**Symptom:** `RWB-06`'s entrypoint (`src/index.js`) is a single trivial function that never imports or references `node-forge`:

```js
function formatAuthHeader(token) {
  return `Bearer ${token.trim()}`;
}
module.exports = { formatAuthHeader };
```

The expected verdict is `NOT_AFFECTED` (node-forge is genuinely never touched). The actual verdict was `UNKNOWN`, with the single diagnostic `unsupported_construct at .../src/index.js#formatAuthHeader@5:1` — line 5 is the `return` statement's template literal containing `token.trim()`.

**Root cause, confirmed by direct isolation:** a copy of the fixture was made with the only change being `token.trim()` → plain string concatenation (`"Bearer " + token`, no method call at all). Re-scanning that isolated copy — **still with `node-forge` equally unimported and equally never referenced** — produced the correct `NOT_AFFECTED`, with zero diagnostics:

```
$ diff:  return `Bearer ${token.trim()}`;   →   return "Bearer " + token;
verdict: UNKNOWN → NOT_AFFECTED
```

This proves the mechanism precisely: `checkReachability`'s search (`src/analysis/verdict.ts`) walks the *entire* call graph reachable from an entrypoint, and per its own documented contract (the `buildFinding` docstring: `"unreachable" — which TASK-020 only returns once a search is fully exhausted with no blocking uncertainty`), encountering **any** edge the call graph can't classify anywhere in that reachable subgraph — even one with no path toward the rule's actual target — sets `sawUnknown = true` for the whole search, which downstream becomes `UNKNOWN` rather than a confident `NOT_AFFECTED`. In this case, `String.prototype.trim()` — a completely ordinary built-in method call, unrelated to node-forge in every way — was itself an "unsupported_construct" the call graph couldn't classify, and that alone was sufficient to suppress the correct verdict.

**Why this matters:** this is architecturally the *correct*, deliberately conservative behavior per `AGENTS.md`'s core rule (never infer `NOT_AFFECTED` merely because something failed to resolve) — but its blast radius is much larger than that rule's original framing suggests. It means **any** construct the call graph doesn't fully model, anywhere in an entrypoint's reachable code — not just code touching the vulnerable dependency — prevents a confident `NOT_AFFECTED` for *every* vulnerability checked against that entrypoint. Real-world application code is dense with exactly this kind of construct (as this same benchmark run also shows: anonymous functions, cross-file re-exports, bundler output — `RWF-003`/`RWF-004`/`RWF-006`). This is very likely a *compounding* factor behind several of this run's other `UNKNOWN` results (`RWB-01`, `RWB-02`, `RWB-03`, `RWB-05`, `RWB-08`, `RWB-09a`) in addition to each of those cases' own primary resolution gap — fixing only the primary gap in each of those cases may not be sufficient by itself if other, unrelated unresolved constructs remain anywhere else in the same reachable subgraph.

**Relevant files:** `src/analysis/verdict.ts` (`checkReachability`, `buildFinding`), `src/analysis/reachability.ts` (`analyzeReachability`'s `unknown`-state propagation).

**Proposed direction (not scoped, not implemented):** this is a genuine soundness-vs-precision tradeoff, not simply a bug to fix — narrowing it (e.g., scoping "blocking uncertainty" to unresolved edges that lie on *some* path toward the target, rather than anywhere in the reachable subgraph) would need careful analysis to confirm it can't introduce a false `NOT_AFFECTED`. Flagging the tradeoff itself as the finding, not prescribing a fix.

**MVP-readiness relevance:** does not violate any adversarial-suite invariant (still 79/79) — the adversarial fixtures are, by construction, minimal and free of incidental unresolved constructs, so this behavior was invisible to them. This is the highest-value finding from this benchmark run precisely because it was invisible to synthetic testing.

### Status update — VT-307d (module-load absence negative proof)

`RWB-06` now returns the expected `NOT_AFFECTED`. Read the scope of that
carefully, because it is **not** the fix this finding's "proposed direction"
above contemplated, and RWF-002's own tradeoff is deliberately untouched:

- Nothing about "blocking uncertainty" was narrowed. `checkReachability`
  still sets `sawUnknown` for **any** unclassifiable edge anywhere in an
  entrypoint's reachable subgraph, exactly as described above, and every
  reachability-derived `NOT_AFFECTED` still requires `graphTruncated ===
  false`. The dangerous change this finding warned against — scoping
  blocking uncertainty to edges "on some path toward the target" — was
  **not** made, and would still need the careful analysis this entry asks
  for.
- Instead, VT-307d added a **second, independent** route to `NOT_AFFECTED`
  that never consults the call graph at all: a `ModuleLoadClosure` over the
  configured entrypoints. When that closure is **complete** and this
  finding's exact canonical `PackageInstanceId` is **not** in its
  `loadedPackageInstances`, the affected package's code cannot execute from
  those entrypoints at all — so no call-graph search is needed to know that
  no call into it can happen either.
- Why unrelated non-widening uncertainty is safe to ignore **on that route
  specifically**: a construct that could actually load a module the
  traversal never saw is *closure-widening*, and every closure-widening
  construct makes the closure incomplete, which withdraws the proof
  entirely. `token.trim()` — this finding's own trigger — is
  `unsupported_construct`: non-widening, bounded to values already
  discovered, and incapable of loading `node-forge`. It therefore stops
  vetoing a conclusion it has no bearing on, without anything being
  assumed about it.

So the blast radius described above is genuinely reduced, but only for the
UNREACHED_DEPENDENCY shape: a package that is installed and never loaded.
A vulnerable package that IS loaded, with an unattributable target or an
unresolved call path, still returns `UNKNOWN` for precisely the reasons
this finding gives (`RWB-07`, `RWB-08`, `RWB-09a`, `RWB-10` are all
unchanged). The compounding effect this entry predicted for those cases is
real and still stands.

## RWF-003 — `module.exports` assigned as an anonymous function expression isn't matched to a function node

**Discovered:** scanning real `minimist@1.2.5` (`RWB-02`) against real GHSA-xvch-5gv4-984h / CVE-2021-44906.

**Symptom:** `parseArgs()` calls `minimist(argv)` directly — a plain call to the package's default export, one same-file hop from the entrypoint. Expected `AFFECTED`; actual `UNKNOWN`, with `unresolved_target at .../src/cli.js#parseArgs@6:1` plus dozens of `unsupported_construct` diagnostics pointing into `minimist`'s own internal implementation (the call graph attempts to walk into the callee and can't classify its internals either).

**Root cause, confirmed by reading the real installed `node_modules/minimist/index.js`:**

```js
module.exports = function (args, opts) {
    if (!opts) opts = {};
    ...
};
```

Contrast with `url-parse` (`RWB-04`, which correctly resolved `AFFECTED`): `module.exports = Url;` where `Url` is a **named, locally-declared function** (`function Url(address, location, parser) {...}`). `mapExportsToFunctions` (`src/code-intelligence/module-model.ts`) resolves an export by looking up `index.functions.find(fn => fn.name === localKey)` — a **name-based** lookup against the file's own indexed function declarations. `minimist`'s default export is an anonymous function expression assigned directly as the `module.exports` value; it has no name to match against, so this lookup fails and the export resolves to a phantom node instead of the real function.

**Why this matters:** `module.exports = function (...) {...}` is an extremely common, idiomatic CommonJS pattern for single-purpose packages that don't bother naming their sole exported function — `lodash.template`/`url-parse` (both handled correctly) happen to use named functions/identifiers, but plenty of real packages don't.

**Relevant files:** `src/code-intelligence/module-model.ts` (`mapExportsToFunctions`), `src/analysis/verdict.ts` (`findExportNodeInFile`).

**Proposed direction (not scoped, not implemented):** when an export's value is an anonymous function/arrow expression with no local name, match against the expression's own AST node directly (already indexed somewhere in `source-index.ts`'s function table under a synthetic or positional key) rather than requiring a name match at all — a targeted extension to `mapExportsToFunctions`, not a broader resolution rewrite.

**MVP-readiness relevance:** does not violate any adversarial-suite invariant (still 79/79) — no existing adversarial fixture uses a bare anonymous-function `module.exports` value.

---

## RWF-004 — An exported value re-exported from a different file (same package or a different package) is never chased to its real declaration

**Status: the SAME-PACKAGE half (RWF-004a) is fixed; the cross-package half
(RWF-004b) remains open.**

`src/code-intelligence/commonjs-reexports.ts` now derives a CommonJS
re-export ORIGIN (`{specifier, importedName?}`) for an export whose value
comes from a literal `require()` — directly, or through exactly one hop of a
module-scope, provably single-assignment local binding — and
`module-model.ts` carries it on `ExportBinding.commonJsReExport`.
`call-graph.ts`'s `resolveReExportChain` chases it, composing across hops
and across syntaxes with the existing ESM chase, and is gated on the target
file belonging to the **same canonical PackageInstance** (`identifyModule`),
so a relative `../` specifier, a same-name/same-version install at a
different path, and a bare cross-package specifier are all refused. Dynamic
specifiers, conditionals, chained aliases (RWF-012) and files that declare
their own `exports`/`module`/`require` binding all produce no origin at all
and keep their previous UNKNOWN.

**Result:** `RWB-09a` moved `UNKNOWN` → `AFFECTED` (the correct answer;
see below and RWF-009). No other validation case moved, and no case moved
into `NOT_AFFECTED`. `RWB-05` (`qs`) and `RWB-08` (`debug`→`ms`) still fail,
each for a *second*, independent reason documented below.

**Discovered:** scanning real `qs@6.10.1` (`RWB-05`), real `debug@2.0.0`/`ms@0.6.2` (`RWB-08`), and real `semver@7.5.1`/`7.5.2` (`RWB-09a`/`RWB-09b`).

**Symptom, `qs` (the clearest case):** `toQueryString()` calls only `qs.stringify(filters)` — the *safe*, unrelated export; `qs.parse` (the vulnerable one) is never referenced at all. Expected `NOT_AFFECTED`; actual `UNKNOWN` for **both** the vulnerable and the safe finding, with `unresolved_target at .../src/serialize-filters.js#toQueryString@6:1` — the diagnostic points at the *safe* call site, confirming the failure is in resolving `qs.stringify` itself, unrelated to the rule's own target (`qs.parse`).

**Root cause, confirmed by reading the real installed `node_modules/qs/lib/index.js`:**

```js
var stringify = require('./stringify');
var parse = require('./parse');
var formats = require('./formats');
module.exports = { formats: formats, parse: parse, stringify: stringify };
```

Both `parse` and `stringify` are **local variables whose values come from `require()`ing other files** (`lib/parse.js`, `lib/stringify.js`) — not functions declared within `lib/index.js` itself. `mapExportsToFunctions`'s same-file name lookup (see `RWF-003`) has no way to find them, since the real function bodies live in different files entirely.

**Same mechanism, two real-world variants confirmed:**
- **`semver@7.5.1`/`7.5.2` (`RWB-09a`/`RWB-09b`):** `module.exports = { Range: require('./classes/range'), ... }` — the re-exported value is referenced *inline* in the object literal, not even via an intermediate variable. Both the vulnerable (`7.5.1`) and patched (`7.5.2`) instances hit this identically (`unresolved_target` at both `isCompatible@8:1` and `isLegacyCompatible@12:1`).
- **`debug@2.0.0` → `ms@0.6.2` (`RWB-08`):** the hardest variant — `debug.js:14`: `exports.humanize = require('ms');`. Here the re-export crosses a **package boundary**, not just a file boundary within one package. `src/code-intelligence/module-model.ts` already documents (in `mapExportsToFunctions`'s own comment) that "chasing a re-export to its ultimate source file is not attempted here" — this finding confirms that limitation is real and reachable from genuine, common real-world code (not just theoretical), and additionally shows it applies to the intra-package sibling-file case (`qs`, `semver`), not only the documented cross-package case.

**Why this matters:** splitting a package's implementation across multiple files and assembling `module.exports` from `require()`d pieces is one of the most common real-world CommonJS authoring patterns — arguably more common than a single-file implementation for any package past trivial size. `RWF-001` (lodash) is a *related but distinct* mechanism (a local alias of the `module` identifier itself defeats export-assignment *detection*); this finding is about the *assigned value's provenance* crossing a file boundary, defeating export-to-function *resolution*, even when the assignment itself (`module.exports = {...}`) is textbook-recognizable.

**Relevant files:** `src/code-intelligence/module-model.ts` (`mapExportsToFunctions`'s documented, confirmed-real limitation), `src/analysis/verdict.ts` (`findExportNodeInFile`).

**Proposed direction (RWF-004a: implemented as described; RWF-004b: still open):** when an export's local binding resolves to a `require(...)` call expression (directly, or via one level of local-variable indirection), follow that `require()` to the target file and repeat the same-file function lookup there — a bounded, one-or-few-hop chase (matching `VT-214`'s existing alias-tracking precedent), not unbounded points-to analysis. The cross-package (`RWB-08`) variant is strictly harder (crosses into a different package's own `node_modules` resolution) and was scoped as a separate, later step (**RWF-004b**) from the same-package sibling-file case (**RWF-004a**, now implemented).

**Why `RWB-05` (`qs`) still fails after RWF-004a:** its re-export chain now
resolves correctly, but it terminates in `lib/parse.js` /
`lib/stringify.js`, both of which are
`module.exports = function (str, opts) { ... }` — an **anonymous** function
expression, which is `RWF-003`, not this finding. The chase reaches the
right file and asks for its canonical `"default"` export; that export has no
attributable function, so the target stays honestly unresolved. `RWB-05`
therefore needs `RWF-003` **and** `RWF-004a`, not `RWF-004` alone — a
correction to this document's original single-cause attribution.
Additionally, `RWB-05` expects `NOT_AFFECTED` for an export the application
never calls, which also requires the *uncalled* export to be attributed: the
chase is driven from real call sites, so a re-exported symbol nothing ever
calls is never chased and its implementation file is never discovered. That
is a separate, deliberate scope boundary, not a defect in this relation.

**Why `RWB-08` (`debug`→`ms`) still fails after RWF-004a:** its first hop
(`node.js`'s `exports = module.exports = require('./debug')`) is
same-package and now resolves; its second hop
(`debug.js:14`'s `exports.humanize = require('ms')`) crosses a package
boundary and is refused by design — that is exactly `RWF-004b`.

**MVP-readiness relevance:** does not violate any adversarial-suite invariant (still 79/79) — no adversarial fixture splits a vulnerable library's implementation across multiple files.

---

## RWF-005 — TypeScript module resolution prefers a package's `.d.ts` over its real `.js` implementation

**Status: Fixed (VT-304).** `src/code-intelligence/module-resolver.ts`'s
`resolveSync` now checks whether `ts.resolveModuleName`'s result is a
declaration file (`.d.ts`/`.d.cts`/`.d.mts`, identified via the compiler's
own `ResolvedModuleFull.extension`) and, if so, attempts to identify the
real runtime implementation before ever returning it as a normal
`"resolved"` result: first by re-resolving the same specifier with
TypeScript's internal `noDtsResolution` option (isolated to one function,
`attemptNoDtsResolution`, with a documented, cast, try/catch-guarded call
site), then by a structurally-scoped same-package sibling probe
(`attemptSiblingRuntimeFile`, respecting `package.json`'s own `main` field
when present) as a fallback. If neither finds a real implementation, the
result is now an explicit, first-class `DeclarationOnlyModule` (`kind:
"declaration"`) — never silently treated as an analyzable module.
Downstream, a declaration-only import now produces an explicit
`declaration_only_resolution` call-edge/`DynamicCallReason`, classified as
closure-widening (the real runtime file was never indexed, so its
behavior — including any further `require`/`import` calls — is exactly as
unknown as an unresolved module), and the declaration file itself is never
indexed as a graph node. `RWB-01` now correctly resolves to `AFFECTED`
(previously `UNKNOWN`) with 0 regressions elsewhere in the suite. See
`src/code-intelligence/module-resolver.ts`'s own doc comments and
`src/code-intelligence/module-resolver.test.ts`'s VT-304 test group for the
full regression coverage, including the `@types/*` case (RWB-09's fixture
never actually exercised the `@types/*` shape — its own real `semver`
installs declare `"main": "index.js"` and ship no `.d.ts` at all, so its
remaining failures are exclusively RWF-004/RWF-009, unrelated to this
finding).

**Discovered:** scanning real `trim-newlines@3.0.0` (`RWB-01`) against real GHSA-7p7h-4mm5-852v / CVE-2021-33623.

**Symptom:** `normalize()` calls `trimNewlines.end(userInput)` directly and unconditionally — the simplest possible reachable-call shape in this entire benchmark. Expected `AFFECTED`; actual `UNKNOWN`, with `coverage.modulesResolved: 0`, `modulesUnresolved: 1` — the `require("trim-newlines")` import itself failed to resolve to anything usable, not merely the specific `.end` export.

**Root cause, confirmed via a direct call to VulnTrace's own `createModuleResolver`/`loadTsProject`:**

```
resolver.resolve("trim-newlines", <referenceFile>)
  -> { kind: "resolved",
       resolvedFileName: ".../node_modules/trim-newlines/index.d.ts",
       packageId: { name: "trim-newlines", version: "3.0.0", subModuleName: "index.d.ts" } }
```

TypeScript's module resolution resolved the bare specifier `"trim-newlines"` to the package's **hand-authored `index.d.ts`** (a real, separate type-declaration file `trim-newlines` ships — `declare const trimNewlines: {...}; export = trimNewlines;`) instead of its real `index.js` implementation. A `.d.ts` file has no function bodies — only type signatures — so every downstream step (call-graph construction, `findExportNodeInFile`) operating on this resolved file finds nothing real to analyze. Contrast with `url-parse`/`minimist`/`ini` (none of which ship a `.d.ts`), which all resolve straight to their real `.js`.

**Why this matters:** shipping a separate, hand-authored `.d.ts` alongside plain JavaScript (rather than JSDoc-derived inline types) is a common, idiomatic practice for small, dependency-free utility packages — `trim-newlines` is a representative example, not an edge case. Any such package would hit this same resolution-level failure before export-matching (`RWF-003`/`RWF-004`) is even reached.

**Relevant files:** `src/code-intelligence/module-resolver.ts` (`createModuleResolver`, the underlying `ts.resolveModuleName`/`ts.LanguageServiceHost` configuration it wraps), `src/code-intelligence/ts-project.ts` (`loadTsProject`'s compiler options — likely the `moduleResolution`/`allowJs`/declaration-preference settings governing this choice).

**Proposed direction (not scoped, not implemented):** either adjust the underlying `ts.CompilerOptions` VulnTrace's project uses (there is a documented TypeScript-level knob for preferring `.js` over co-located `.d.ts` in certain resolution modes) or, when a resolution lands on a `.d.ts`, explicitly fall back to probing for a sibling `.js`/`.cjs` file with the same base name before giving up — needs investigation into which is the more correct, general fix rather than a `trim-newlines`-specific patch.

**MVP-readiness relevance:** does not violate any adversarial-suite invariant (still 79/79) — no adversarial fixture package ships a separate `.d.ts`. This is the single most surprising finding in this run given how simple the underlying code pattern is.

## RWF-006 — Webpack-bundled, getter-defined class exports aren't recognized as constructible/method-bearing targets

**Discovered:** scanning real `fast-xml-parser@5.3.3` (`RWB-03`) against real GHSA-37qj-frw5-hhjh / CVE-2026-25128.

**Symptom:** `parseFeed()` constructs `new XMLParser({processEntities: true, htmlEntities: true})` and calls `.parse(xmlText)` on it — a real, live-reproduced two-step (construct, then call) reachable path, structurally identical in shape to the already-working `adv2-020-instance-method`/`adv-020-constructor-invocation` synthetic fixtures. Expected `AFFECTED`; actual `UNKNOWN`, with `unresolved_target` and `unsupported_construct` at the application's own `parseFeed@8:1` call site.

**Root cause, confirmed by reading the real installed CJS bundle `node_modules/fast-xml-parser/lib/fxp.cjs`:**

```js
(()=>{"use strict";var t={d:(e,i)=>{for(var n in i)t.o(i,n)&&!t.o(e,n)&&Object.defineProperty(e,n,{enumerable:!0,get:i[n]})}, ...};
var e={};t.r(e),t.d(e,{XMLBuilder:()=>lt,XMLParser:()=>tt,XMLValidator:()=>pt});
...
module.exports=e
```

This is real webpack-library-mode bundler output: `XMLParser` is exposed via `Object.defineProperty(e, "XMLParser", { get: () => tt, enumerable: true })` — a **dynamically defined getter property**, not a plain assignment (`module.exports.XMLParser = ...`) or an ESM `export class XMLParser`. The adversarial suites' synthetic class fixtures (`vt2-vuln-lib`, `adv-vuln-lib`) all use plain ESM `export class` declarations, compiled straightforwardly; none exercise bundler-generated getter-property output.

**Why this matters:** shipping a webpack (or Rollup/esbuild)-bundled single-file CJS build as the package's real `require()` entry — while keeping separate, unbundled ESM source for `import` consumers — is an increasingly common real-world publishing pattern for dual-format packages (`fast-xml-parser`'s own `package.json` `exports` map does exactly this: `require` → `./lib/fxp.cjs`, `import` → `./src/fxp.js`). A project statically analyzing the `require()` path specifically will hit the bundled getter-based shape, not the original source.

**Relevant files:** `src/code-intelligence/source-index.ts` (whatever recognizes exported class/constructor declarations — needs to additionally recognize `Object.defineProperty(target, name, { get: () => X })` as an export-equivalent binding to `X`), `src/code-intelligence/module-model.ts`.

**Proposed direction (not scoped, not implemented):** recognize the specific `Object.defineProperty(<exportsObject>, "<name>", { get: () => <identifier> })` shape (or its minified equivalent, matched structurally rather than by exact minified variable names) as equivalent to a plain `<exportsObject>.<name> = <identifier>` assignment for export-resolution purposes — narrow and pattern-specific, not a general getter-evaluation feature.

**MVP-readiness relevance:** does not violate any adversarial-suite invariant (still 79/79) — no adversarial fixture ships bundler-generated output; all are hand-authored source.

## RWF-007 — Node builtin specifiers never resolved, producing spurious closure-widening blockers

**Status: Fixed (VT-305).**

**Discovered:** scanning real `handlebars@4.7.6` (`RWB-10`) against real GHSA-f2jv-r9rf-7988 / CVE-2021-23369; also verified directly against `ts.resolveModuleName`.

**Symptom:** `RWB-10`'s `template-engine.js` opens with `const fs = require("fs"); const path = require("path");`, then calls `path.join(...)` and `fs.readFileSync(...)` inside `renderTemplate()`. Both calls produced an `unresolved_module` edge -- a **closure-widening** blocker (`isClosureWideningReason`, `src/domain/graph.ts`) -- entirely unrelated to the case's own intended blocker (the genuinely unresolvable `engines[engineName]` dynamic dispatch). `RWB-10`'s own expected verdict (`UNKNOWN`) never changed, since the intended blocker alone was already sufficient, but the *reason* was polluted, and any application whose reachable subgraph depends on a builtin call one hop earlier than its real target would have been affected for real.

**Root cause, confirmed directly:**

```
resolver.resolve("fs", ...)        -> { kind: "unresolved", ... }
resolver.resolve("path", ...)      -> { kind: "unresolved", ... }
resolver.resolve("node:fs", ...)   -> { kind: "unresolved", ... }
resolver.resolve("crypto", ...)    -> { kind: "unresolved", ... }
resolver.resolve("http", ...)      -> { kind: "unresolved", ... }
```

`ts.resolveModuleName` never resolves Node core specifiers at all -- its knowledge of Node's core API is ambient `@types/node` declarations, not per-specifier module resolution. Every builtin `require`/`import` therefore fell through to `ResolutionFailure` -> `unresolved_module` -> a closure-widening `unknown` edge, exactly as if the specifier named a genuinely missing npm package.

**Why this matters:** essentially every real Node.js application uses at least one builtin (`fs`, `path`, `crypto`, `http`, ...). Combined with `RWF-002` (open; see above), this meant no realistic Node application could ever reach a confident `NOT_AFFECTED` -- far broader blast radius than any single-package finding in this benchmark.

**Fix (VT-305):** `src/code-intelligence/module-resolver.ts`'s `resolveSync` now checks `node:module`'s `isBuiltin(specifier)` *before* attempting any `ts.resolveModuleName`/`node_modules` lookup at all (matching real Node.js semantics, where a builtin always shadows a same-named `node_modules` package) and returns an explicit `BuiltinModule` (`kind: "builtin"`, specifier normalized to its bare unprefixed form so `"fs"`/`"node:fs"` are the same identity). `src/code-intelligence/symbol-binder.ts` and `src/code-intelligence/call-graph.ts` propagate this through as a `SymbolBindingBuiltin`/no graph edge at all -- mirroring `KNOWN_GLOBAL_IDENTIFIERS`'s existing treatment of ambient globals, but checked *after* VT-213's inline-callback fallback has already had its chance, so `fs.readFile(file, callback)`-shaped calls still connect their callback argument correctly. No new `DynamicCallReason` was needed -- builtins produce no edge, so `isClosureWideningReason`'s exhaustive switch is untouched.

**MVP-readiness relevance:** does not violate any adversarial-suite invariant (still 83/83, v1+v2) -- no adversarial fixture imports a Node builtin. `RWB-10`'s own verdict is unchanged (still the correct `UNKNOWN`, via its own intended `unsupported_construct` blocker); the two `unresolved_module` edges attributable to `require("fs")`/`require("path")` are gone from its reachable subgraph.

## RWF-009 — npm-aliased package instance identity mismatch between the dependency graph and the call graph

**Status: Fixed (VT-306).**

**Discovered:** scanning real `semver@7.5.1` installed under the npm-aliased dependency name `semver-vulnerable` (`RWB-09a`) against real GHSA-c2qf-rxjj-qqgw / CVE-2022-25883.

**Symptom:** `isLegacyCompatible()` calls `new legacySemver.Range(userRange)`, where `legacySemver` is `require('semver-vulnerable')` -- a real, live, unconditional reachable call into the real, vulnerable `semver@7.5.1`. Expected `AFFECTED` (modulo the separate RWF-004 gap below); actual (pre-fix) `NOT_AFFECTED` -- a **false negative**, not merely an imprecise UNKNOWN.

**Root cause, confirmed directly:**

```
dependency-graph layer  (package-lock.json entry.name, npm always writes this for an alias):
  "semver-vulnerable" -> name: "semver", locations: ["node_modules/semver-vulnerable"]

call-graph layer (identifyModule(), pre-fix):
  .../node_modules/semver-vulnerable/classes/range.js
    -> packageName: "semver-vulnerable"   (derived from the install DIRECTORY name)
    -> packageInstance: .../node_modules/semver-vulnerable
```

The dependency-graph layer already derived identity correctly (`entry.name`, which npm always writes explicitly for an aliased install, since it can't be inferred from the path). But `src/domain/resolved-target.ts`'s `identifyModule()` -- the call-graph/verdict layer's sole identity function -- derived `packageName` purely from the resolved file's `node_modules/<segment>` path, never consulting the installed instance's own `package.json`. `graphPackageInstances(graph, "semver")` (`src/analysis/verdict.ts`) therefore never matched this instance's nodes (their derived identity was `"semver-vulnerable"`, not `"semver"`), so `resolveTargetNodes` treated the aliased instance as `confirmedAbsentInstance` -- VT-212's guard, correctly designed for a genuinely-never-touched instance, incorrectly triggered here because the instance genuinely *was* touched. Since no closure-widening blocker was reachable in this particular fixture, `confirmedAbsentInstance` degraded straight to `NOT_AFFECTED` instead of `UNKNOWN`.

**Why this matters:** an npm alias (`"name": "npm:realpackage@version"`) is a normal, supported npm feature -- used for side-by-side major-version installs, gradual migrations, and forks. Every such install has this exact shape (directory name != package.json name), so this affected every real-world alias, silently converting a genuinely reachable, vulnerable instance into a confident, false `NOT_AFFECTED`.

**Fix (VT-306):** `identifyModule()` now reads the owning installed package instance's own `package.json` `"name"` field (new `readInstalledPackageName` helper, mirroring `analysis/verdict.ts`'s existing `readInstalledVersion` pattern/fallback discipline) and prefers it over the path-derived segment when present and valid -- falling back to the path-derived name only when `package.json` is missing, unreadable, or has no valid `name` (never manufacturing a new UNKNOWN merely because metadata was unavailable). `packageInstance` (the install *location*) is completely unaffected -- an alias never changes *where* a package is installed, only what it should be called. Both `node_modules/semver` and `node_modules/semver-vulnerable` now correctly report `packageName: "semver"` while keeping distinct `packageInstance` values, so `graphPackageInstances` finds both, and VT-212's exact-instance-wins selection logic operates on the correct instance's own nodes -- never borrowing the separate, patched instance's evidence.

**Result:** `RWB-09a` moved from `NOT_AFFECTED` (false negative) to `UNKNOWN` (safe) -- verified directly against the call graph: `isLegacyCompatible()`'s call now resolves to the correct `semver-vulnerable` instance, whose own `Range` export is `require('./classes/range')`, a cross-file re-export never chased (**RWF-004**, open, out of this task's scope) -- an honest `unresolved_target`, not a confident answer either way. `RWF-004` remains the sole, independent, correctly-attributed remaining blocker.

**MVP-readiness relevance:** does not violate any adversarial-suite invariant (still 83/83, v1+v2) -- no adversarial fixture uses an npm alias. VT-212's own regression tests, ADV2-045, and VT-300's multi-instance dynamic-loading cases were all explicitly re-run and remain correct (none of their fixtures alias a package name away from its directory name, so path-derived and package.json-derived identity already agreed for all of them).

## RWF-012 — CommonJS chained export alias (`exports.foo = exports.bar = impl`) isn't attributed to its implementing function

**Discovered:** scanning real `ini@1.3.5` (`RWB-07`) against real GHSA-qqgx-2p2h-9c37 / CVE-2020-7788 (prototype pollution in `ini.parse`).

**Symptom:** VT-301B's independent architecture review surfaced this while auditing the phantom-target Site A fix (see `docs/REAL-WORLD-BENCHMARK-AUDIT-V0.1.md`): `RWB-07`'s prior `PASS` (`NOT_AFFECTED`) turned out to be built on an unresolved target, not a genuinely identified one. Before VT-301B, the rule's `ini#parse` target fell through to a phantom node; a reachability search against that phantom happened to conclude `NOT_AFFECTED` only because the configured `{file: src/config.js, symbol: loadModernConfig}` entrypoint's own reachable subgraph is trivially edge-less (`loadModernConfig` calls only `JSON.parse`, a known global with no call-graph edge at all) — the *target itself* was never actually resolved, before or after VT-301B. After VT-301B, the same unresolved-target state correctly reports `unresolvedReason` directly (SDD.md § 23's "vulnerable target known? NO → UNKNOWN"), so `RWB-07` now (correctly) reports `UNKNOWN` instead of an accidental `NOT_AFFECTED`.

**Root cause, confirmed by reading the real installed `node_modules/ini/ini.js`:**

```js
exports.parse = exports.decode = decode
exports.stringify = exports.encode = encode
...
function decode (str) { ... }
```

The rule's target names the **public, canonical export** (`parse`) — but the function implementing it is declared under a **different name** (`decode`), assigned to `exports.parse` only via a **chained assignment expression** (`exports.parse = (exports.decode = decode)`). Confirmed directly: zero functions anywhere in `ini.js` are literally named `"parse"` — the export-symbol attribution path (`mapExportsToFunctions`, `src/code-intelligence/module-model.ts`) can only bridge an `exports.foo = ...` binding back to a real function declaration when the assigned identifier's own name coincides with the export name (or the RHS is a directly-visible function expression); it has no mechanism for tracing through an **aliasing assignment chain** to the ultimate function that chain resolves to. `buildExportBindings`'s `commonjs-exports-property` case (`src/code-intelligence/source-index.ts`) records the export's `exportedName` (`"parse"`) but never captures a `localName` for this shape at all — so the lookup key defaults to the export name itself (`"parse"`), which the real function's own name (`"decode"`) never matches.

**Why this matters:** chained/aliased CommonJS export assignments (`exports.publicName = exports.internalAlias = implementation`) are a real, if less common, authoring idiom — used here specifically so `ini.decode`/`ini.parse` (and `ini.encode`/`ini.stringify`) are both valid, interchangeable public names for the same implementation. This is a **different** mechanism from RWF-004's re-export chasing (which is about a value **imported from another file/package**) and from RWF-003's anonymous-function gap (which is about a **missing** name, not a **mismatched** one) — here the implementing function has a real, resolvable name, just not the one the export uses.

**Relevant files:** `src/code-intelligence/source-index.ts` (`buildIndex`'s `commonjs-exports-property` case never records a `localName` for a chained/aliased RHS), `src/code-intelligence/module-model.ts` (`mapExportsToFunctions`'s `localKey` fallback to `exportedName`, which only coincidentally works when the assigned identifier's own name matches the export name).

**Proposed direction (not scoped, not implemented):** when an `exports.foo = <expr>` (or `module.exports.foo = <expr>`) assignment's RHS is itself another assignment expression (`exports.bar = decode`) or a bare identifier referencing a locally-declared function, capture that identifier as the binding's `localName` (chasing through one or more chained assignment layers, bounded the same way VT-214's alias tracking already is) rather than defaulting to the export's own name — a targeted extension to `buildExportBindings`/`describeCommonJsExportTarget`, not a general aliasing/points-to feature.

**MVP-readiness relevance:** does not violate any adversarial-suite invariant (still 79/79) — no adversarial fixture uses a chained/aliased `exports.foo = exports.bar = impl` assignment. `RWB-07`'s own oracle (`expected: NOT_AFFECTED`) is unchanged by this finding: a human analyst reading `src/config.js` with the configured entrypoint in mind still concludes `NOT_AFFECTED` with no ambiguity (`loadLegacyIniConfig` is genuinely unreachable from `loadModernConfig`) — this finding is about *why the analyzer itself* can no longer reach that same conclusion with adequate coverage, now that it correctly refuses to guess at an unresolved target.
